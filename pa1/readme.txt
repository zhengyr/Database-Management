Your school needs a database system to help with the construction of their class schedules (or timetable). A timetable is a day- to-day schedule describing what classes are taught when and to whom. By using a database to manage timetables, the constructor of a schoolâ€™s timetable (the timetable) can define queries that determine individual teacher schedules and individual student schedules. As well, queries can reveal conflicts in the timetable, such as teacher conflicts which occur when a teacher has been scheduled to teach two classes at the same time, and homeroom conflicts which occur when a student has been scheduled to take two classes at the same time.
