The purpose of PA3 is to give you a better understanding of this tradeoff by designing your own B+-Trees. You will be asked to implement a set of Java classes that together implement a B+-Tree. To make your life easier, you will be provided an API for the classes you need to implement. You need to understand what each method in the API is for and implement it according to the appropriate algorithm.
